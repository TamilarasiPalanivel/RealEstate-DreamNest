# StayTrack
StayTrack is a hotel room booking and management system that allows users to view, book, and manage hotel rooms. The platform provides an easy-to-use interface for customers to book rooms, check availability, and get booking confirmations. The backend handles user authentication, room availability management, and booking confirmation. StayTrack uses a **voucher-based** system for booking confirmation.
